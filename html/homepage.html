        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p id="about-me">
          I'm a 4th year computer science student currently looking for an
          internship. I enjoy programming and solving problems among many other
          things. This website is a personal project I created to teach myself
          basic web development using online web resources, such as video guides
          and documentation. Web development is one of the skills I am currently
          teaching myself. When I'm not programming I enjoy playing sports,
          working out, and going on hikes.
